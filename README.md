## This Chemistry App is a simple calculator to calculate Acid Value for the given inputs

```
Weight Of OIL
Volume of KOH
'N' of KOH
```
```
Acid Value = (Volume of 0.1mol/L KOH Consumed x 5.611) / (Weight of the sample)
```

```
A vegetable oil was tested for its acid value, 10 gm of oil required 0.2 mi of KOH.
Find its acid value. Also mention can it be useful for lubrication.(Normality of KOH =0.02 N)
Sol:
Weight Of OIL = 10gm
Volume of KOH = 0.2
'N' of KOH    = 0.02

Acid Value = (Volume of 0.1mol/L KOH Consumed x 5.611) / (Weight of the sample)

Acid Value = 0.0224 mg of KOH /gm of oil

As acid value is less than 0.1 mg/gm oil is suitable for lubrication.
